# VM-Translator
I found and initiated a project to implement a VM translator based on Project 7 from Nand2Tetris. This will take high level code from the programing language Jack and translate it into the Hack assembly language code.

To use this program do the following steps:

Step 1. Download the 3 files: translate.java, CodeWriter.java, and Parser.java

Step 2. Use this command to compile the program:
```javac translate.java CodeWriter.java Parser.java```

Step 3. Make a file to be your input. For example you can use the basic.vm file to test this program. The input file must have valid Jack code syntax.

Step 4. Run the following command:
```java translate inputFile.vm outputFile,asm```

You must be in the same directory as your compiled files and input file or else this will not work.

Thank you for your time.
